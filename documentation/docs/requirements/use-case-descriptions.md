# Use-case descriptions

## Use Case 1 – Account Creation

**As a user, I want to create an account so that my journal entries and settings are saved securely and available across devices.**

1. **Access Registration:** Upon launching ReflectCare for the first time, the app displays a Welcome screen with Sign Up and Log In buttons. The user taps Sign Up.
2. **Enter Details:** The app presents the Create Account form, asking for:
   - Email address
   - Password (with strength indicator)
   - Optional display name
   The user fills in the fields and taps Register.
3. **Validate & Confirm:** The system verifies the email isn’t already in use and that the password meets complexity rules. If validation passes, the app sends a verification link to the user’s email and shows:
   > Check your inbox to verify your account.
4. **Email Verification:** The user clicks the link in their email. The app confirms verification and automatically logs them in.
