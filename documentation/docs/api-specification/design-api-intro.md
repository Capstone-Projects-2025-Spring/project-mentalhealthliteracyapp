Design Document - Part II API
=============================

**Purpose**

This Design Document gives the complete design of the software implementation. This information should be in structured comments (e.g. Javadoc) in the source files. We encourage the use of a documentation generation tool to generate a draft of your API that you can augment to include the following details.

**Requirements**

In addition to the general documentation requirements the Design Document - Part II API will contain:

General review of the software architecture for each module specified in Design Document - Part I Architecture. Please include your class diagram as an important reference.

**For each class define the data fields, methods.**

The purpose of the class.

The purpose of each data field.

The purpose of each method

Pre-conditions if any.

Post-conditions if any.

Parameters and data types

Return value and output variables

Exceptions thrown\* (PLEASE see note below for details).

An example of an auto-generated and then augmented API specification is here ([Fiscal Design Document 2\_API.docx](https://templeu.instructure.com/courses/106563/files/16928898?wrap=1 "Fiscal Design Document 2_API.docx") )

This group developed their API documentation by hand ([Design Document Part 2 API-1\_MovieMatch.docx](https://templeu.instructure.com/courses/106563/files/16928899?wrap=1 "Design Document Part 2 API-1_MovieMatch.docx") )

\*At the top level, or where appropriate, all exceptions should be caught and an error message that is meaningful to the user generated. It is not OK to say ("xxxx has encountered a problem and will now close (OK?)". Error messages and recovery procedures should be documented in the User's Manual.

## Mental Health Literacy App - Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

The Mental Health Literacy App is built using a modern React-based architecture with the following key components:

#### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for client-side navigation
- **Styling**: CSS modules with component-specific stylesheets
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect)
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

#### Backend Services
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data persistence
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (planned integration)
- **Video Hosting**: Mux for video streaming capabilities
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers for edge computing

#### Component Architecture

    └── RequestAuth     # Authentication helpers
```

### Data Flow

1. **User Interface Layer**: React components handle user interactions
2. **Service Layer**: Utility functions and services manage business logic
3. **Data Layer**: Supabase client handles all database operations
4. **External Services**: Mux for video streaming, planned integrations for resources

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Component Composition**: Small, focused components composed into larger features
2. **Props Interface Pattern**: TypeScript interfaces define component contracts
3. **Service Abstraction**: Database and auth logic separated from UI components
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
5. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### API Documentation Structure

This API documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. **[Components API](./components-api.md)**: All React UI components
2. **[Pages API](./pages-api.md)**: Page-level components and routing
3. **[Services API](./services-api.md)**: Service layers and utilities
4. **[Interfaces & Types](./interfaces-types.md)**: TypeScript type definitions

Each section follows the requirements outlined above, documenting:
- Purpose and functionality
- Data fields and props
- Methods and their contracts
- Pre/post conditions
- Error handling approaches
- Dependencies and relationships
