# VideoService Unit Tests

## Testing Framework and Approach

The VideoService unit tests utilize **Vitest** and **Supabase mocking** to ensure comprehensive coverage of video processing functionality.

- **Vitest** provides fast, reliable testing with Jest-compatible syntax, making it ideal for testing service classes and utility functions. It supports comprehensive mocking and generates detailed coverage reports.
- **Supabase mocking** allows testing of database interactions without requiring a real database connection, ensuring tests are fast, reliable, and isolated from external dependencies.

These libraries are particularly suitable for VideoService testing because they enable testing of complex business logic, database interactions, and error handling scenarios in isolation.

---

**Primary Focus:** Test VideoService methods in isolation to ensure video processing, like functionality, and tag generation work as expected across various scenarios.

**Testing Tools:**
- **Vitest:** Fast test runner with comprehensive mocking capabilities
- **Supabase mocking:** Mock database interactions using `vi.mock()` and `vi.hoisted()`
- **Error simulation:** Test various error scenarios and edge cases

---

Each method includes multiple test cases covering different scenarios and edge cases.

A test case consists of input parameter values, mocked dependencies, and expected results.

All external dependencies (Supabase, authentication) are stubbed using mock objects to ensure test isolation.

## VideoService Methods Overview

### `getTagsForVideo(description: string)`
Generates tags based on video description content using keyword matching and case-insensitive search.

### `processVideosWithLike(videos: any[])`
Processes video arrays, adds tags, calculates like counts from userInteractions table, and determines like status for authenticated users.

### `updateLike(videoId: number)`
Handles like/unlike functionality by updating userInteractions table and calculating like counts dynamically.

### `getLikedVideos()`
Retrieves videos that the current authenticated user has liked, with like counts calculated from userInteractions table.

## Test Coverage and Scenarios

### Tag Generation (`getTagsForVideo`)

#### Test Scenarios
- **Test:** Returns CBT tag when description contains "cbt"
  - **Input:** description = 'This is a CBT therapy session'
  - **Expected Result:** Array containing `{ label: 'CBT', url: '/resources/cbt' }`
- **Test:** Returns multiple tags for multiple keywords
  - **Input:** description = 'CBT therapy for depression and stress management'
  - **Expected Result:** Array containing CBT, Therapy, Depression, and Stress tags
- **Test:** Case insensitive matching
  - **Input:** description = 'CBT THERAPY for ANXIETY'
  - **Expected Result:** Tags found regardless of case
- **Test:** Returns empty array when no keywords found
  - **Input:** description = 'Just a regular video about cooking'
  - **Expected Result:** Empty array `[]`

### Video Processing (`processVideosWithLike`)

#### Test Scenarios
- **Test:** Processes videos for unauthenticated users
  - **Input:** videos array, user = null
  - **Expected Result:** Videos with tags and calculated like counts, `isLiked: false` for all
- **Test:** Processes videos for authenticated users with likes
  - **Input:** videos array, user = authenticated, userLikes = [videoId: 1]
  - **Expected Result:** Videos with correct like status based on user's likes and calculated like counts
- **Test:** Handles database errors gracefully
  - **Input:** videos array, database error when fetching likes
  - **Expected Result:** Videos processed without like status, no error thrown
- **Test:** Throws error when Supabase client unavailable
  - **Input:** videos array, supabase = null
  - **Expected Result:** Error thrown with message 'Supabase client not available'

### Like Functionality (`updateLike`)

#### Test Scenarios
- **Test:** Likes a video when user hasn't liked before
  - **Input:** videoId = 1, user = authenticated, no existing interaction
  - **Expected Result:** `{ success: true, newLikeCount: 1, isLiked: true }`
- **Test:** Unlikes a video when user has already liked
  - **Input:** videoId = 1, user = authenticated, existing like = true
  - **Expected Result:** `{ success: true, newLikeCount: 0, isLiked: false }`
- **Test:** Throws error for unauthenticated users
  - **Input:** videoId = 1, user = null
  - **Expected Result:** Error thrown with message 'User must be authenticated to like videos'
- **Test:** Handles database errors gracefully
  - **Input:** videoId = 1, database error during operation
  - **Expected Result:** Error thrown with database error message

### Liked Videos Retrieval (`getLikedVideos`)

#### Test Scenarios
- **Test:** Returns liked videos for authenticated user
  - **Input:** user = authenticated, likedVideoIds = [1, 2], videos data available
  - **Expected Result:** Array of liked videos with `isLiked: true` and calculated like counts
- **Test:** Returns empty array when user has no liked videos
  - **Input:** user = authenticated, likedVideoIds = []
  - **Expected Result:** Empty array `[]`
- **Test:** Returns empty array when user is not authenticated
  - **Input:** user = null
  - **Expected Result:** Empty array `[]`
- **Test:** Handles database errors gracefully
  - **Input:** user = authenticated, database error when fetching liked videos
  - **Expected Result:** Empty array `[]`

## Test Implementation Details

### Mocking Strategy

The VideoService tests use a comprehensive mocking strategy to isolate the service from external dependencies:

```typescript
// Mock the supabase module
const mockSupabase = vi.hoisted(() => ({
  auth: {
    getUser: vi.fn(),
    getSession: vi.fn(),
  },
  from: vi.fn(),
}));

vi.mock('../../lib/supabase', () => ({
  default: () => mockSupabase,
}));
```

### Test Structure

Each test follows the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern:

1. **Arrange:** Set up test data and mock responses
2. **Act:** Execute the method being tested
3. **Assert:** Verify the expected outcomes

### Error Handling Tests

Error handling is thoroughly tested across all methods:

- Database connection errors
- Authentication failures
- Invalid input data
- Network timeouts
- Missing dependencies

## Current Test Status

### Test Results
All 17 VideoService unit tests are currently passing, providing comprehensive coverage of the service's functionality.

### Coverage Areas
- **Tag Generation:** 5 tests covering keyword matching and edge cases
- **Video Processing:** 4 tests covering authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios
- **Like Functionality:** 4 tests covering like/unlike operations and error handling
- **Liked Videos Retrieval:** 4 tests covering data retrieval and error scenarios

### Performance Metrics
- **Test Execution Time:** Approximately 8ms for all VideoService tests
- **Coverage:** 100% method coverage with comprehensive scenario testing
- **Reliability:** All tests pass consistently across different environments

## Best Practices and Standards

### Test Organization
- Tests are grouped by method for logical organization
- Each test has a descriptive name that clearly indicates its purpose
- Test scenarios cover both positive and negative cases
- Edge cases and error conditions are thoroughly tested

### Mocking Guidelines
- External dependencies are consistently mocked across all tests
- Mock data reflects realistic application usage patterns
- Error scenarios are simulated for comprehensive coverage
- Test isolation is maintained to prevent interference

### Assertion Patterns
- User-facing functionality is tested for expected behavior
- State changes and data persistence are verified
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms are validated
- Performance and reliability are considered in test design

## Integration with Development Workflow

The VideoService unit tests are integrated into the project's development workflow:

1. **Automated Testing:** Tests run on every commit and pull request
2. **Coverage Reporting:** Detailed coverage reports are generated and tracked
3. **Quality Gates:** Tests must pass before code can be merged to main branch
4. **Documentation:** Test results are documented and tracked for quality assurance

This comprehensive testing approach ensures the VideoService maintains high quality and reliability as the codebase evolves and new features are added.
