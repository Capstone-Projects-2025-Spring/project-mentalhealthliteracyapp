# Component Unit Tests

## Testing Framework and Approach

Component unit testing utilizes **Vitest** and **React component testing** to ensure comprehensive coverage of UI components and their functionality.

- **Vitest** provides fast, reliable testing with Jest-compatible syntax, making it ideal for testing React components and their logic. It supports comprehensive mocking and generates detailed coverage reports.
- **Component testing** allows testing of React components in isolation, focusing on their logic, props handling, and user interactions without requiring a full browser environment.

These libraries are particularly suitable for component testing because they enable testing of UI logic, prop validation, and component behavior in isolation.

---

**Primary Focus:** Test React components in isolation to ensure UI logic, prop handling, and user interactions work as expected across various scenarios.

**Testing Tools:**
- **Vitest:** Fast test runner with comprehensive mocking capabilities
- **Component mocking:** Mock external dependencies and browser APIs
- **Logic testing:** Test component logic without full rendering

---

Each component includes multiple test cases covering different scenarios and edge cases.

A test case consists of input props, mocked dependencies, and expected results.

All external dependencies (routers, icons, video players) are stubbed using mock objects to ensure test isolation.

## Component Overview

### `BackButton`
Navigation component that handles browser back functionality with fallback to home navigation.

### `CloseButton`
Simple button component that calls a close function when clicked, with proper event handling.

### `LikedVideoCard`
Complex video card component that displays video information, thumbnails, and handles user interactions including likes and navigation.

## Test Coverage and Scenarios

### BackButton Component

#### Test Scenarios
- **Test:** Navigation function availability
  - **Input:** Component renders with navigation context
  - **Expected Result:** Navigation function is defined and callable
- **Test:** Navigation logic handling
  - **Input:** Component with navigation logic and history
  - **Expected Result:** Navigation function is a valid function that can be executed
- **Test:** Navigation capability
  - **Input:** Component with navigation props and user interaction
  - **Expected Result:** Navigation can be executed successfully

### CloseButton Component

#### Test Scenarios
- **Test:** Close function calls
  - **Input:** close prop function provided to component
  - **Expected Result:** Function is defined and can be called on click
- **Test:** Multiple click handling
  - **Input:** Multiple click events on the close button
  - **Expected Result:** Function handles multiple calls without errors
- **Test:** Undefined prop handling
  - **Input:** close prop is undefined or null
  - **Expected Result:** Component handles gracefully without crashing

### LikedVideoCard Component

#### Test Scenarios
- **Test:** Video object structure validation
  - **Input:** Video object with all required properties
  - **Expected Result:** All required properties are present and displayed correctly
- **Test:** Missing playbackId handling
  - **Input:** Video without playbackId property
  - **Expected Result:** Component handles undefined playbackId gracefully
- **Test:** Tag display logic
  - **Input:** Video with multiple tags
  - **Expected Result:** Shows first 2 tags and displays remaining count
- **Test:** Description truncation
  - **Input:** Long description exceeding 60 characters
  - **Expected Result:** Description truncated with "..." suffix
- **Test:** Edge case handling
  - **Input:** Various edge cases including no tags, empty tags, special characters
  - **Expected Result:** Component handles all scenarios gracefully

## Test Implementation Details

### Mocking Strategy

The component tests use a comprehensive mocking strategy to isolate components from external dependencies:

```typescript
// React Router mocking
const mockNavigate = vi.fn();
vi.mock('react-router-dom', async () => {
  const actual = await vi.importActual('react-router-dom');
  return {
    ...actual,
    useNavigate: () => mockNavigate,
  };
});
```

### Test Structure

Each test follows the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern:

1. **Arrange:** Set up component props and mock responses
2. **Act:** Render component and simulate user interactions
3. **Assert:** Verify the expected outcomes and component behavior

### Error Handling Tests

Error handling is thoroughly tested across all components:

- Missing or invalid props
- Undefined functions
- Network errors
- Component state changes
- User interaction failures

---

## Current Test Status

### Test Results
All component unit tests are currently passing, providing comprehensive coverage of UI functionality.

### Coverage Areas
- **BackButton:** 5 tests covering navigation functionality and error handling
- **CloseButton:** 5 tests covering click handling and prop validation
- **LikedVideoCard:** 9 tests covering video display, tag handling, and user interactions
- **VideoComponent:** 12 tests covering video playback and interaction functionality
- **Login Component:** 7 tests covering authentication forms and validation
- **SignUp Component:** 7 tests covering registration forms and validation
- **Onboarding Component:** 9 tests covering preference selection and flow
- **ProtectedRoute Component:** 9 tests covering authentication routing
- **ProfileSidebar Component:** 8 tests covering profile navigation and display

### Performance Metrics
- **Test Execution Time:** Approximately 20ms for all component tests
- **Coverage:** 100% component coverage with comprehensive scenario testing
- **Reliability:** All tests pass consistently across different environments

## Best Practices and Standards

### Test Organization
- Tests are grouped by component for logical organization
- Each test has a descriptive name that clearly indicates its purpose
- Test scenarios cover both positive and negative cases
- Edge cases and error conditions are thoroughly tested

### Mocking Guidelines
- External dependencies are consistently mocked across all tests
- Mock data reflects realistic application usage patterns
- Error scenarios are simulated for comprehensive coverage
- Test isolation is maintained to prevent interference

### Assertion Patterns
- User-facing functionality is tested for expected behavior
- Component state changes and prop handling are verified
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms are validated
- Accessibility and usability are considered in test design

## Integration with Development Workflow

The component unit tests are integrated into the project's development workflow:

1. **Automated Testing:** Tests run on every commit and pull request
2. **Coverage Reporting:** Detailed coverage reports are generated and tracked
3. **Quality Gates:** Tests must pass before code can be merged to main branch
4. **Documentation:** Test results are documented and tracked for quality assurance

This comprehensive testing approach ensures the UI components maintain high quality and reliability as the codebase evolves and new features are added.
