## Integration with Development Workflow

The acceptance tests are integrated into the project's development workflow and CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Automated Testing**: Tests run on every commit and pull request
2. **Coverage Reporting**: Detailed coverage reports are generated and tracked
3. **Quality Gates**: Tests must pass before code can be merged to main branch
4. **Documentation**: Test results are documented and tracked for quality assurance

This comprehensive testing approach ensures the application maintains high quality and meets all functional requirements as the codebase evolves and new features are added.
