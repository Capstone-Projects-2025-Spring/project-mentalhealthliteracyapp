The app is designed to make learning about mental health topics engaging, accessible, and less intimidating. By presenting content in a familiar, scrollable format, it encourages users to explore different therapy modalities, self-care strategies, and personal stories. The app serves as a bridge to deeper knowledge, providing a curated resource hub for users who wish to learn more. The goal is to empower users with self-awareness, provide a seamless path to vetted information, and proactively encourage them to seek professional help when they feel they need it, all without pressure or clinical labeling."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"conceptual-design",children:"Conceptual Design"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The frontend of the app will be developed using React and TypeScript, with Vite used for fast development and build optimization.
