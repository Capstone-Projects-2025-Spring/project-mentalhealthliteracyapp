The app is designed to encourage users to regularly reflect and document their thoughts and feelings, fostering awareness and emotional clarity. Unlike diagnostic tools, this app will not attempt to label or assess users' mental health conditions. Instead, it aims to build trust through a safe, non judgmental journaling experience. As users engage with the app, they will be gently guided toward accessible, vetted mental health resources should they choose to seek additional support. The goal is to empower users with self-awareness and provide a seamless bridge to professional help when needed without pressure, stigma, or clinical labeling."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"conceptual-design",children:"Conceptual Design"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The frontend of the app will be developed using React and TypeScript, with Vite used for fast development and build optimization.

All user data, including journal entries and preferences, will be securely stored in this PostgreSQL database. The frontend will be deployed using Cloudflare for fast, reliable global delivery.

While the approach of the user-experience for both are based in scientific research, they both can bombard the user with many options, lots of questions, and may feel overwhelming.
